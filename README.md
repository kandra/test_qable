# Test-qable

## Getting Started

Install QAble and their dependencies if you  haven't yet:

```
bundle install
```

With the dependencies installed you can proceed to run tests.

## Browsers Support

QAble supports Chrome and Firefox by default in OSX and Linux
without installing any extra dependencies.

Internet Explorer and Edge are supported through a Selenium
Server (instructions about setting a server are below)

Safari support under OS X is under work.

## Running tests

```
bundle exec rake
```

By default tests are run in all supported browsers to change that edit
the `config.yml` in project directory.

The results of the tests are displayed in console and saved to `reports`
folder on the project.

## Referencing Paths

Paths can be referenced by url or name in features files.

To specify paths by url just puth the url that you want to visit, e.g:

```
Given I go to /sign_in
```

To specify paths by name add the alias in paths section in the `config.yml`:

```
paths
  login: /sign_in
```

and reference it in the feature file:

```
Given I go to login page
```

## Adding custom step definitions

Custom step definitions can be added in the `features/step_definitions` folder
in the project. By default `custom_steps.rb` file lives in this folder
and can be edited to add the new steps.

## Visualizing Failing tests

The screenshots for failing tests are saved by default in `reports`
folder and displayed in the corresponding report file along with the failing
step.

## Page Object Support

Page Object Model DSL is supported if the `site_prism` gem is added to the
project's Gemfile.

To use Page Object Model just add the Ruby files describing the site to
the `page_objects` folder in the project.

Check [SitePrism](https://github.com/natritmeyer/site_prism#siteprism)
for more details about using Page Object Model DSL.

## Windows Browsers support through Selenium Server

QAble can be used with Selenium Server to run tests in browsers not
supported by OS X.

First download `selenium-server-standalone` and `IEDriverServer` from
[Selenium website](http://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=3.6/)

For Edge download [Microsoft WebDriver](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/)


Start a Selenium Hub:

```
java -jar selenium-server-standalone-3.6.0.jar -role hub
```

Register IE Node (change the location of IEDriverServer.exe according to
your system)

```
java -Dwebdriver.ie.driver=C:\Users\User\Selenium\IEDriverServer.exe -jar selenium-server-standalone-3.6.0.jar -role node -hub http://10.0.2.15:4444/grid/register -browser "browserName=internet explorer,platform=WINDOWS,maxInstances=10"
```

Register Edge Node (change the location of MicrosoftWebDriver.exe according to
your system)

```
java -Dwebdriver.edge.driver=C:\Users\User\Selenium\MicrosoftWebDriver.exe -jar selenium-server-standalone-3.6.0.jar -role node -hub http://10.0.2.15:4444/grid/register -browser "browserName=MicrosoftEdge,platform=WINDOWS,maxInstances=10"
```

Edit the `remote_ci_url` in your project `config.yml` and set it to the
Selenium Hub URL, e.g:

```
remote_ci_url: http://192.168.56.2:4444/wd/hub
```


### Internet Explorer caveats

- If you’re running a 64-bit version of Windows, do not go with the 64-bit IE
  driver for IE 10+. This is the source of incredibly slow typing.

- IE 11 requires a registry key to be set, otherwise connections to the browser
  process will drop out. [Here’s a registry export snippet]() for 64-bit Windows.

- Some systems require moving the Security level from `High` to `Medium`
  in Internet Options -> Security to work correctly.
